Submit this file with your answer for tutorial 6.
You should edit the file with notepad or textedit, not with BlueJ

This is practice for the test!

You will get your marks for the tutorial if you have made some
reasonable attempt - the code does not have to be all correct to get
the marks. 


Complete the makeArtistMap() method below.  It uses the Song class.

/** SongManager class contains two field:
 *  a Set of Songs,
 *  a map that associates each artist name with a List of all the
 *     songs by that artist. Each list should be ordered by the year of the song. 
 */
public class SongManager { 
    private Set<Song> allSongs;                    // Collection of Songs
    private Map<String, List<Song>> songsByArtist; // Map: artist -> Sorted list of Song

  /**  
   * Constructs the songsByArtist map using the collection of Songs in allSongs,
   * Each List of songs in the map should be sorted by year.
   */ 
    public void makeArtistMap(){ 
        songsByArtist = new HashMap<String, List<Song>>();       
        // ANSWER: 
	for (Song song: allSongs){
		songsByArtist.put(song.getArtist(),song);
	}
	songsByArtist.sort( );
 
     }
	



/** Class to represent information about a song */
public class Song { 
    private int year; 
    private String artist, title; 
  
    public Song(String artist, String title, int yr) { 
        this.year = yr; 
        this.artist = artist; 
        this.title = title; 
    } 
    public int compareTo(Song other){
	if (getYear() > other.getYear()){return 1;}
	else if (getYear() < other.getYear()){return -1;}
	else{return 0;}
    }
    
    public String  getArtist() { return artist; } 
    public String  getTitle()  { return title; } 
    public Integer getYear()   { return year; } 
}
